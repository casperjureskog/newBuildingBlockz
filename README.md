# Building Blocks Back End

Building Blocks backend is the last project for CraftAcademy Cohort (Feb-April 2017). This is the back end of the app for housing societies that will accept help message request from tenants, send work request to janitors, receive booking of facilities and manage users account (tenant, admin and janitor).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for deployment and testing purposes.  See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

In order to organize the features needed for our project and track our progress, we used different tools such as:

**Pivotal Tracker**
[Pivotal Tracker for Building blocks](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2007795).

**GitHub**
This site base reside on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/building_blocks_back_end).

### Installing
Install the pg driver:
```
gem install pg
```
On OS X with Homebrew:
```
gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
```
On OS X with MacPorts:
```
gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config
```
On Windows:
```
gem install pg
```
Choose the win32 build.
Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.

Configure Using Gemfile
```
 gem 'pg'
 ```
### Scaffold Ruby on Rails
If you don't have Rails installed beforehand, it is time to install it now. Rails is a ruby gem, so you can install it as any other gem:
```
$ gem install rails
```
Once you are done it is time to scaffold the Rails application we will be working with.
```
$ rails new building_blocks_back_end --database=postgresql --skip-test --skip-bundle
```
## Built with
* Ruby on Rails
